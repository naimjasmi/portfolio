        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello there! I'm a 23-year-old enthusiast born in the charming town of Teluk Intan, 
            Perak, and currently residing in vibrant Shah Alam, Selangor. My journey in the realm 
            of computer science began at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), where I pursued both my 
            Diploma and ongoing Degree, fueled by a passion for technology and innovation. Alongside 
            my academic pursuits, I've cultivated a love for creative expression, finding joy in sketching, 
            digital drawing, and imaginative thinking. When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, I'm out on 
            the badminton or football court, embracing the thrill of sports and staying active. Photography 
            is another avenue through which I unleash my creativity, capturing life's moments with precision 
            and flair. With a knack for editing, I transform ordinary images into captivating masterpieces. 
            My diverse interests and experiences shape my holistic 
            approach to life, allowing me to thrive in both the realms of technology and creativity.</p>

            <h3>Facial Emotion Recognition System For School Counsellor</h3>
            <p>
                The "Facial Emotion Recognition System for School Counsellor" is a web 
                application that utilizes advanced technology to analyze facial expressions 
                of students in real-time. By capturing images through a webcam or uploaded 
                photos, the system employs Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural 
                Networks (CNN) to detect and recognize various emotions such as happiness, sadness, 
                anger, fear, and surprise. The user interface, developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, 
                provides an intuitive platform for school counsellors to interact with the system and gain 
                insights into the emotional well-being of students. This project aims to equip counsellors 
                with valuable tools to support students' emotional needs and foster a positive school environment.</p>
